# History of the POSTHUMAN validator

The POSTHUMAN validator began its history in 2019, with the validation of the [Cyber](https://cyb.ai/) test network.
Initially, the validator was called Immortal, but after the first jail, it became clear that validator was still far away from immortality, and the Immortal validator was renamed POSTHUMAN.

On January 21, 2021, the POSTHUMAN validator began validating the main network [Starname](https://www.mintscan.io/starname/transactions/1749AB38438428ED84346EFBF488DCB15C1729CAC6B8072EAB4486B36D1D6C9C)
At the moment (September 2023), POSTHUMAN validates 40+ networks, and is one of the leading validators in terms of the number of individual delegators.
The full list of networks is listed [here](https://github.com/Validator-POSTHUMAN/About-POSTHUMAN)

At the moment, the POSTHUMAN validator is under the decentralized governance of the POSTHUMAN delegator community.
Decentralized governance occurs using DAS (Decentralized Autonomous Synchronization), by creating and voting on proposals.
POSTHUMAN delegators can make any decision on the development of the POSTHUMAN validator, as well as change any parameters of the validator in any network.

The core team is responsible for developing the validator and contributing to the development of networks and communities.
At the moment, the POSTHUMAN core team consists of 10 people:
Initially, there was only one person behind the POSTHUMAN validator - [Vladi](https://github.com/Antropocosmist).
After the number of validated main networks reached 13, [Albert](https://github.com/albertandrejev) joined Vladi, taking on the technical side of validation.
The third member of the team was [Vova](https://twitter.com/vova_synthetic), taking on the responsibility of creating video content.
Afterwards, [Valentin](https://github.com/Medniyy) joined the team to help with community development, organizing and holding events.
The fifth participant, as an advisor and programmer, was [Mikhail](https://github.com/krogla).
Afterwards, one after another, [Evgeniy](https://github.com/evgen3000) joined the team - to work with big data, and [Daniil](https://github.com/saloonn) - as a designer .
Further, two people immediately joined the core team to help with the development of the community: [Ekaterina](https://twitter.com/LooMay1913) and [Sergey](https://twitter.com/s__orion).
The tenth member of the team was [Nikita](https://github.com/web3validator/web34ever-identity/blob/main/web34ever-self-identity.md), taking responsibility for participating in testnets.
