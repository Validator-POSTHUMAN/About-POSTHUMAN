## 1. Important information!
> The information in this presentation may change over time, based on unforeseen situations, and by the will of the Community! 
> Any changes will be by the will and in the interests of the Community!

## 2. General information

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4927b79f-221a-4e4d-9679-4bf18f7535d4)

POSTHUMAN validator is not only 13 individuals behind the validator.
All our delegators in all networks is also a part of our team! And we really pleased to all our delegators.
We want to show our respect, and share 20% of POSTHUMAN profit from all networks with our delegators!

> Token Symbol: $PHMN
> Format: CW20 (token on Juno Network)
> Max Supply: 131,072
> Decimals: 6
> Capitalization: 20% of POSTHUMAN profit from all networks, which will be converted into $JUNO or the other token paired with $PHMN
> Purpose: Investment Tool + Governance
> Utility: Hold, Invest, Transfer, Exchange, Govern DAS, Earn Privilege

## 3. Tokenomics
> Why don’t we just cut commissions by 20% in all networks?
At the first, we already have minimal commissions in the most of networks and can’t make them more low.
At the second, in several networks we have big delegations from the foundation, but a little delegations from the community. We want to share profit from from such networks with our delegators, as our delegators is also our team!

> Who will get $PHMN?
We want to distribute $PHMN by 4 categories:
- Individual delegators (foundations will not get $PHMN as they already get contributions from POSTHUMAN validator, and individual delegators contribute to networks by delegating to POSTHUMAN)
- $PHMN-holders
- POSTHUMAN core-team
- Liquidity Pool PHMN/JUNO

> Distribution of $PHMN by 4 categories for the period from 2022 to 2030

Within 8 years (from 2022 to 2030), the POSTHUMAN validator will issue 131,072 $PHMN-tokens in CW20 format on the Juno Network blockchain, the value of which will be equal to 20% of the total profit from all networks that POSTHUMAN validates both in the present and in future.

> At the moment, these are 39 Main Networks, 29 of them are eligible for $PHMN [distribution](https://github.com/Validator-POSTHUMAN/list_for_PHMN_distribution). We validate Cosmos Ecosystem chains and beyond! 

## Genesis liquidity providing 

To give the value to $PHMN token, we will create PHMN/JUNO Liquidity Pool on the junoswap.com (obsolete) platform.

Initially, 50,000 $PHMN will be created, which will be directed to the Liquidity Pool on one side once, while the second side of the Liquidity Pool will be constantly replenished with $JUNO.

Approximately once every 72 hours, 20% of all profits from all networks validated by POSTHUMAN will be converted into $JUNO.

Half of the received $JUNO will be used to purchase $PHMN, after which the PHMN/JUNO Liquidity Pool will be replenished with $JUNO and $PHMN in equal proportions.

As a result, one side of the PHMN/JUNO Pool will remain almost unchanged, while the other side will constantly increase, which will lead to a constant increase in the price of the $PHMN token.

> Currently we supply liquidity on Osmosis, due to market conditions and DAS decision. You can find all liquidity injection events in our Telegram via searching [something like this.](https://t.me/posthumanchat/31524)

## 4. Example for better understanding
The data in the “Example for better understanding” is not real data!
It doesn’t count real changes in the ratio of the amount of $PHMN and $JUNO in the Liquidity Pool, and it’s provided solely to explain the mechanics of replenishing the PHMN/JUNO Liquidity Pool.
This data should not be the basis for investment!

For example, we have PHMN/JUNO Liquidity Pool.
On one side of the Pool 50,000 $PHMN, on the other side 1,000 $JUNO.
Ratio in LP: 1 $PHNM = 0.02 $JUNO

The POSTHUMAN validator receives 20% of the profits (as an example: the equivalent of 200 $JUNO)

100 $JUNO is spent to buy 5,000 $PHMN, after which the ratio in the Liquidity Pool becomes 45,000 $PHMN <-> 1,100 $JUNO.

Thereafter, 5,000 $PHMN and 100 $JUNO are added to the Liquidity Pool, after which the ratio in LP becomes 50,000 $PHMN <-> 1,200 $JUNO.
Ratio in LP: 1 $PHNM = 0.024 $JUNO

This example doesn’t reflect the real change in the ratios of $PHMN and $JUNO in LP, and it’s a simplification for a better understanding of the process of replenishing the PHMN/JUNO Liquidity Pool

## 5. Creation and Distribution of $PHMN
The creation and distribution of $PHMN tokens will take place over 8 years: from 2022 to 2030, in 60 stages:
- 61,072 $PHMN (~ 46.6% of Max Supply) will be created and distributed during 2022 in 4 stages
- 70,000 $PHMN (~ 53.4% ​​of Max Supply) will be created and distributed over the next 7 years (from 2023 to 2030) in 56 stages (8 stages per year)

The allocation to the Delegators and Holders categories will be based on surprise network snapshots that will take place every quarter from Q2–2022 to Q4–2029

## 6. Stages of $PHMN Distribution
50,000 $PHMN (~ 38.1%) → PHMN/JUNO Liquidity Pool Allocation for 1 stage in period Q1–2022;
49,000 $PHMN (~ 37.4%) → POSTHUMAN Delegators Distribution over 59 stages:
- 3 stages (1 time per quarter) in the period Q2-Q3-Q4–2022;
- 56 stages (2 times per quarter) from Q1–2023 to Q4–2029;
31,000 $PHMN (~ 23.7%) → $PHMN-holders Distribution over 58 stages:
- 2 stages (1 time per quarter) in the period Q3-Q4–2022;
- 56 stages (2 times per quarter) from Q1–2023 to Q4–2029;
1,072 $PHMN (~ 0.8%) → POSTHUMAN core-Team Allocation over 8 stages:
- 1 time every Q4 from 2022 to 2029;

## 7. $PHMN utility
- Hold: Between Q3–2022 and Q4–2029 (inclusive), the $PHMN token can be held for the purpose of receiving future StakeDrops ($PHMN Holders will in general be allocated ~23.7% of the Max Supply)
- Investing: The $PHMN token can be used as an investment instrument, as under the Expected Development Scenario and thanks to tokenomics, the price of $PHMN in $JUNO will constantly increase
- Cross-chain Transfer: The $PHMN token can be transferred both within the Juno Network and between any blockchains with an implemented IBC-Protocol
- Decentralized Exchange: $PHMN token can be exchanged for any paired token on [Osmosis DEX](app.osmosis.zone) or any other source with sufficient liquidity. 
- Govern DAS: The $PHMN token will enable the creation of proposals and voting on proposals within the Decentralized Autonomous Synchronization that drives the economic development of the POSTHUMAN validator
- Getting Privileges: The $PHMN token will give a number of privileges for receiving merch and NFTs from the POSTHUMAN validator, as well as bonuses for the initial distribution of tokens from the Sputnik Network

## 8. Data on the development of the POSTHUMAN validator

> Since 2019 and until 2024 we dramatically rose. We validate 39+mainnets and several testnets, we have 10+k YouTube channel, 120k+individual delegators and way more! 

> Here's the list of validated chains and history of our validator - https://github.com/Validator-POSTHUMAN/About-POSTHUMAN

- In the period from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2024, POSTHUMAN core-team has grown from 1 person to 13 people
- The total capitalization of funds delegated to the POSTHUMAN validator exceeded $31,000,000 (*as of 25.07.2024 and only Mintscan supported)
- 20% of daily profit from all networks validated by POSTHUMAN exceeded $200 (*as of March 24, 2022)
- POSTHUMAN is one of the most active validators, contributing to the development of Networks and Communities, which helps to attract new delegations from both community members and project funds

## 9. What else to expect?
(needs to be updated)
- Issuance of useful NFTs for long-term POSTHUMAN delegators:
“1 month staker”, “3 months staker”, “6 months staker”, “1 year staker”.
- The owners of these NFTs will receive more $PHMN with each round of distribution. Details will be published later.
- Swag (bags, t-shirts, hoodies) with POSTHUMAN branding, available exclusively for $PHMN
- StakeDrop of $NETR tokens for $PHMN holders at the launch of the Sputnik Network blockchain

## 10. Road map
Q1–2022
Establishment of PHMN/JUNO Liquidity Pool
Q2–2022
3,000 $PHMN StakeDrop (~2.3% of Max Supply) for all POSTHUMAN Individual Delegators on all networks validated by POSTHUMAN
The full list of networks validated by POSTHUMAN is here

Q3–2022
Launch of Decentralized Autonomous Synchronization (analogous to DAO with adapted name) to manage the economic development of the POSTHUMAN validator;
4,000 $PHMN StakeDrop(~3.1% of Max Supply) for Individual Delegators and $PHMN-holders;
Q4–2022
4,072 $PHMN StakeDrop (~3.1% of Max Supply) for Individual Delegators, $PHMN-holders and POSTHUMAN core-team.
Every year, from 2023 to 2028 inclusive, StakeDrops for Delegators and Holders will be made twice a quarter.
And every Q4, a small amount of $PHMN will be distributed among the core-team:
- Each Q1:
1,000 $PHMN -> Holders (Two StakeDrops of 500 $PHMN)
1,500 $PHMN -> Delegators (Two StakeDrops of 750 $PHMN)
- Each Q2:
1,000 $PHMN -> Holders (Two StakeDrops of 500 $PHMN)
$1,500 PHMN -> Delegators (Two StakeDrops of 750 $PHMN)
- Each Q3:
1,000 $PHMN -> Holders (Two StakeDrops of 500 $PHMN)
1,500 $PHMN -> Delegators (Two StakeDrops of 750 $PHMN)
- Each Q4:
928 $PHMN -> Holders (Two StakeDrops of 464 $PHMN)
1,428 $PHMN -> Delegators (Two StakeDrops for 714 $PHMN)
144 $PHMN -> POSTHUMAN core-team with one StakeDrop
In 2029, StakeDrops for Delegators and Holders will be made twice a quarter. And in Q4–2029, a small amount of $PHMN will be distributed among the core-team:
- Q1–2029:
1,000 $PHMN -> Holders (Two StakeDrops of 500 $PHMN)
1,500 $PHMN -> Delegators (Two StakeDrops of 750 $PHMN)
- Q2–2029:
1,000 $PHMN -> Holders (Two StakeDrops of 500 $PHMN)
$1,500 PHMN -> Delegators (Two StakeDrops of 750 $PHMN)
- Q3–2029:
1,000 $PHMN -> Holders (Two StakeDrops of 500 $PHMN)
1,500 $PHMN -> Delegators (Two StakeDrops of 750 $PHMN)
- Q4–2029:
932 $PHMN -> Holders (Two StakeDrops of 466 $PHMN)
1,432 $PHMN -> Delegators (Two StakeDrops for 716 $PHMN)
136 $PHMN -> POSTHUMAN core-team with one StakeDrop
Starting in 2030, the Max Supply will be reached and the $PHMN StakeDrops will end.
At the same time, 20% of the profits will continue to be converted into $JUNO, half of which will be used to purchase the $PHMN token in order to replenish the PHMN/JUNO Liquidity Pool in equal proportions, until New (yet not appearing) Technologies that will change our world.
But since the unlock of $JUNO tokens for Juno Network developers will not happen until 2033, you can be sure that until 2033 everything will go according to plan!
